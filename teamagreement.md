Main branch will be locked down. 
Each implementation will require a separate branch and a pull request, requiring 3 users to verify before code is pushed to main branch.
Each feature will be divided into its own branch to prevent conflict merges.
We not work on a branch for longer than two weeks to prevent code from becoming too outdated.
Prefer squashing to commit to main.
