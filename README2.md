# Overview
 
{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.}
 
{This web-based chat application allows users to express their emotions through color-coded messages. By selecting one of four pre-defined emotions (happy, sad, angry, or neutral), users can instantly color-code their messages. This visual cue can enhance communication and understanding in online conversations, especially in text-based environments where nonverbal cues are absent. You just need to log in,choose one of the four emotion options displayed on the screen and type your message in the chat box. Your message will be displayed in the chat window with the color corresponding to the selected emotion.}
 
 
{If this is an online class, then provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
